Hello, I am Kiwifruit. and welcome to my GitHub Profile

I don't use GitHub often, since I'm a solo programmer writing in Python

While you are here, please do check out my repos. I might add one sometime in the future

Who am I?
-----------
Again, I am Kiwifruit.I am a 13-year-old boy that is obsessed with programming and computers, A.K.A. A nerd

I got into programming after my tutors gave me a sample of their thesis project for feedback. They are CS Majors. And of course,
this happened when I was 8.

Nothing really much happened about my life related to programming before March 2020. As I got selected to compete with other schools in
a robot battle thingy (I forgot what it's called lol).I lost against my oponent, and I learned that Robo-combat is not my thing, so I dropped it

<h3>I wouldn't be called a Programmer if I never made programs</h3>
So while COVID-19 is having a shit ton of fun killing businesses and keeping me in prison, I found Python, which I fell in love
For all you people who came to my profile without knowing how to even write the most basic of scripts, Python is a programming language that revolves
around readablility, mimicing English and enforcing indentation on every corner.

If you wanna contact me, You can't lol

Anyways, have a nice day
